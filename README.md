This program allows simultaneous playback of video and audio files, with separate volume control and the ability to delay audio by a user-specified amount of time, as well as optionally trimming the output video.

Currently, customization is lacking and many options are hardcoded, as this project is originally intended for personal use, to mitigate a ReLive bug where microphone audio clips are out-of-sync with their respective video clips.
